# Text Sentiment Analysis with Caikit and Hugging Face ðŸ¤–
### **Author : Cognitive Class AI**

## Overview
Caikit is an open source AI toolkit that enables users to manage models through a set of developer friendly APIs. It provides a consistent format for creating and using AI models against a wide variety of data domains and tasks. Caikit streamlines the management of AI models for application usage which enables developers to write applications that consume AI models who may not understand the intricate details of the AI models that they use.

## Mentee Information
- **Name:** Farhan Firmansyah
- **Program:** IBM Advanced AI

## Learning Objectives
After completing this lab you will know how to:
- Install Caikit runtime and required libraries
- Create a Python client application that calls a Hugging Face sentiment analysis model
- Invoke the sentiment analysis model with example text strings and review the output

## Prerequisites
- Linux/MacOS x86_64 [Skills Network Lab environment provides this]
- Caikit (v0.9.2) [We will install this]
- Python (v3.8+) [Skills Network Lab environment has python3.8 pre-installed]
- pip (v23.0+) [As first task in the project we will upgrade pip to latest]

## Procedure
Complete the following tasks to configure the Caikit runtime and the AI model, and then test them from a client application:
- Create the project
- Create the data model specification
- Create the model wrapper
- Include the module and package dependencies
- Start the Caikit runtime
- Test the sentiment analysis
